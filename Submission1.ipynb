    "1.\tClearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n",
    "This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report **(having your Introduction/Business Problem section ONLY for now)** to your Github repository and submit a link to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tDescribe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.\n",

Part of the JSON file is significant in examining our calls to Foursquare API and to transform our dataframe for analysis. Relatively, making calls to Foursquare location data will get our given values to make our comparison. Eventually, this dataset results will help us solve the question if our two-factor (Rating and Price) approach sufficient to recommend a venue.  "
